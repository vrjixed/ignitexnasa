# IgniteX NASA Space Apps Challenge

Without the sun life on Earth would not exist - naturally we are all curious to know more about it. But how do we get close enough to something that is 150 million km away from man-kind? And even if someone does, how to understand it? IgniteX is a digital interactive space-comic book app that onboards young learners to traverse the journey to sun, unbox the scientific learnings and prepare themselves for being the next architect of future Sun missions. Sunstruck dreams is the first micro-comic in this series that welcomes young learners onboard as a co-pilot on the Parker Solar Probe Mission. We have chosen AR comic app as a medium to increase engagement and cognitive understanding
